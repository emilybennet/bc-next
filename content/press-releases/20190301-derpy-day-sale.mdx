# BronyCon Celebrates Derpy Day with a Weekend of Savings

(BALTIMORE) - Friday, March 1, 2019, marks the ninth ever Derpy Day where we as a fandom celebrate our favorite grey postal mare by showing our appreciation for others and doing good deeds.

In show of that, BronyCon is discounting its 4-Day and 4-Day PLUS badges by \$9.69 for the entire weekend! This will be the biggest discount offered for badges this year, so interested individuals who haven’t picked one up should consider doing so.

The sale will run from 12:01 AM (EST) Friday March 1 through 11:59 p.m. (EST) Sunday March 3. Apply the promo code “MUFFIN” prior to picking a badge type on Eventbrite or [use this link to apply the code directly](https://bronycon2019.eventbrite.com/?discount=MUFFIN#tickets).

Don’t forget to #GiveAMuffin on social media and show off how your doing good this weekend! Our social media squad will be looking out for some random acts of kindness and will be throwing out some likes, retweets, or maybe some good deeds itself.
