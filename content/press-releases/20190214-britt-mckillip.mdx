# BronyCon Calls in Britt McKillip For Special Love Assignment

(BALTIMORE) - Our field agents at BronyCon work hard to bring yearly operatives only the best with our convention. Sometimes, that work needs a little touch of love to make it wonderful for everyone and our next special agent knows how to do just that. We’re pleased to announce Britt McKillip as our next Guest of Honor for BronyCon 2019!

The final BronyCon event this year will also be the first visit for agent McKillip. She is best known to “My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic” fans for her role as the leader of love, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, a.k.a. Princess Cadance. McKillip has also provided the voice of Lyra Heartstrings, as well as Tra La La from Generation 3 of “MLP.”

McKillip also has an impressive resume outside of “My Little Pony” as well. Her additional roles include Princess Harumi on “Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitsu,” Cloe in the “Bratz” series, as well as Hannah Marie in the “Scary Godmother” series of films. Outside of voice acting, Britt and her sister Carly make up the country music duo, One More Girl.
