# Lauren Faust Comes to BronyCon to Inspire Agents

(BALTIMORE)​ - As an event, BronyCon is only one part of a passionate, loving, and expansive community focused around “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.” For nearly a decade the show has helped unite people across the globe and inspired others to do and create things they may have never thought possible. For our final mission this August we wanted to bring in a very special agent who is an expert on this subject. BronyCon is honored to announce Lauren Faust as our next Guest of Honor for our 2019 event!

This will be Faust’s second ever appearance at BronyCon and her first since the convention moved to Baltimore. She last attended back in 2012 when our event was held in Secaucus, New Jersey. The Annapolis, MD-native is best known as the Developer of “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic” and as the Executive Producer for the first two seasons.

Faust’s vision and passion for creating shows for girls outside of conventional norms helped MLP:FiM become a show that people of all ages and genders can enjoy. She was also one of the Executive Directors on the documentary “Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony.”

Special agent Faust’s work on My Little Pony is only one aspect of the major impact she has had on animation. In her two decade plus long career, she has had the opportunity to work on multiple classic cartoons, some alongside her husband and fellow animation director Craig McKraken, including the early 2000’s version of “The Powerpuff Girls” where she served as a director, supervising director, writer, and as a storyboard artist. After “PPG” she worked a variety of roles on “Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends,” including developer, director, character designer, and animation director. Faust followed that by working as a developer, co-producer, director, writer, and character designer for “Wander Over Yonder.” She has also worked as an animator on the animated feature film and cult classic, “The Iron Giant.”

Currently, Faust’s serves as Executive Director of “DC Super Hero Girls,” a action-adventure animated show she created that began as a web series and currently airs on Cartoon Network. The show is based on teenaged-versions of superheroes such as Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and others at Metropolis High School.
