# BronyCon Launches Vendor Hall Applications and Spirit Badges For 2019

(BALTIMORE) - Next year, BronyCon 2019 will play host to a number of memorable moments where numerous attendees will take home keepsakes that they’ll treasure forever. We know that some individuals who are not able reach Baltimore still want to take part. Because of that, we’re excited to announce a way for those that want to have a piece of BronyCon history; Spirit Badges! We’re also happy to announce the opening of Marketplace applications, for those who who want to vend some of those keepsakes.

Spirit Badges are for those who want to attend the convention in spirit, while also helping to support the final event. Each badge package has a base price of $35, with an extra $10 fee for international shipping. Every package will contain a 2019 Spirit Badge, 2019 Program Book, attendee lanyard, and Mystery Item(s). These packages will be processed and packed during the weekend of BronyCon and mailed out after the event ends.

Those interested in purchasing a Spirit Badge or learning more can do so at [https://bronycon.org/donate#spirit](https://bronycon.org/donate#spirit).

In addition, we’re pleased to say that interested parties can now sign up for a chance to vend at BronyCon. Blank Canvas’s Marketplace holds a plethora of unique exhibitors and serves thousands of attendees every year. Multiple booth sizes and configurations are available to choose from as well. This does not include Artist Alley or Art Show however, which will open applications at a later date.

With a mix of both new and returning faces expected to apply, interested individuals and groups can go to [https://bronycon.org/exhibit](https://bronycon.org/exhibit) and fill out an application. BronyCon’s Marketplace team has updated its guidelines for those looking to sell in the Marketplace and encourages all parties, including returning ones, to thoroughly read it on the BronyCon website.
