# BronyCon Opens Art Show Application and Charity Submissions

(BALTIMORE)—As the weeks leading to BronyCon 2019 pass the work continues at headquarters preparing materials for the final mission. Some items, highly crafted and unique, are still needed and that’s why we’re excited to announce the opening of applications for this year’s Art Show! Those that aren’t as artistically inclined will be happy to know the charity auction submission form has also been opened.

BronyCon’s Art Show is an opportunity for creators of all types to showcase and sell their art without the pressure and commitment of exhibitor space. Any person, including those already selling items inside the vendor hall or artist alley, may submit an original piece of work to the show. Accepted items include 2D art (ie posters, prints, etc), 3D art (ie sculptures, plushies, etc), and more. The Art Show is an ideal setting for those who are seeking a chance to get their creations in front of potential fans.

This year, BronyCon will donate a portion of sales from the Art Show to [CureSearch for Children’s Cancer Research](https://curesearch.org/). Artists who submit items can choose the amount of the final sale price they would like to donate.

Those interested in more information or having their work featured in the show can visit [bronycon.org/exhibit](/exhibit). The form will be open until Monday, July 1st.

Those that have non-self made items or want their creation possibly displayed to a larger audience can consider donating to the charity auction! The auction will take place on Sunday as the penultimate event and all proceeds will once again go to CureSearch. Interested individuals can find the form at [bronycon.org/donate](/donate).
