# BronyCon Goes to Where it all Began with Bonnie Zacherle

(BALTIMORE) - It’s a bittersweet day here at BronyCon HQ as we celebrate the eighth anniversary of our first event and are announcing our final special agent for our final mission this August. Knowing the weight this announcement carries we wanted to bring in someone important to My Little Pony fans from all over the world. In fact, without this special agent’s creativity and vision, none of the missions in our long history would have ever been possible. On this special day, BronyCon is honored to announce Bonnie Zacherle as our final Guest of Honor for 2019!

This will be Zacherle’s first ever visit to BronyCon. She is best known as the original creator of My Little Pony, and its precursor, My Pretty Pony, while working at Hasbro in the early 1980s. The properties were inspired by Zacherle’s childhood memories of horses and horse riding. Her career also includes working on a redesign of Mr. Potato Head, as well as working on the Nerfuls toy line for Parker Brothers. After that, she opened a studio with her Hasbro colleague Liz Knight in a converted barn in Massachusetts which focused on freelance work, design, and consultation services.

Zacherle was honored in 2013 at the first annual My Little Pony Fair by being the first inductee into the My Little Pony Hall of Fame. Currently, Zacherle lives in Virginia where she teaches art to children.
