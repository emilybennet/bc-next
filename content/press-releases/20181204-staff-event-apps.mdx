# BronyCon Launches Staff and Activity Applications

(BALTIMORE) - With the 2018 calendar year winding down, the excitement for BronyCon 2019 is only just starting! Our team has been hard at work and we’re excited to announce the launch of our full fledged website, the opening of activity applications, and our staff applications also going live.

Firstly, we’re happy to announce the launch of our 2019 website! Updated information regarding the convention can be at [bronycon.org](https://bronycon.org) including policies, information on sponsor badge tiers, FAQs, and other helpful information.
