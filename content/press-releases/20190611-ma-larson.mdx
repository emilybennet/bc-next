# M.A. Larson Helps Write the Final Tale for BronyCon

(BALTIMORE) - The final BronyCon mission will be one for the ages. For an epic event like this we need a special agent that can chronicle it with vivid visuals, whimsical words, and adventurous adverbs. And with the task at hand, we need someone who won’t just wing it. BronyCon is proud to announce M.A. Larson as our next Guest of Honor!

Larson will be appearing at his second BronyCon in a row, and fifth overall. He is best known as one of the writers for “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,” a role Larson has had since the show’s beginning in 2010. Some of his most notable episodes include the Season 5 two-part premiere “The Cutie Map,” which was nominated for a Hugo Award for “Best Dramatic Presentation;” the Season 3 finale “Magical Mystery Cure;” and the 100th episode of the series, “Slice of Life.”

Larson’s writing career expands beyond “MLP” into other animated titles such as “Littlest Pet Shop,” “Gravity Falls,” “Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends,” and “Sym-Bionic Titan.” Currently, he is the head writer for “DC Super Hero Girls,” which debuted this year on Cartoon Network, with fellow Guest of Honor Lauren Faust as Executive Producer.

In addition, Larson is the creator behind the adventure book series, “Pennyroyal Academy.” The series focuses on a girl named Evie who emerges from the forest and into a kingdom where princesses and knights do battle against witches and dragons.
