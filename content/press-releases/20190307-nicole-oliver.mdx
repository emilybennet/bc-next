# Nicole Oliver Helps Lead The Final BronyCon Cast

(BALTIMORE) - Leadership is a vital skill needed at BronyCon HQ. You need someone who is kind, yet firm. Someone who knows when to lighten the mood when the time is right, stand tall when it’s needed, and someone who can teach and inspire other agents to be their best. We’re happy to say this next special agent exemplifies all those traits and more. BronyCon is proud to announce Nicole Oliver as our next Guest of Honor for 2019!

This will be special agent Oliver’s 5th appearance at BronyCon and her first since 2015. Oliver is best known as the voices of Princess Celestia and Cheerilee, two leaders in their own right, in “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.” She’s also played multiple fan favorite characters such as Tree Hugger, Spitfire, Fleur de Lis, and more.

Outside of “MLP:FiM,” Oliver has worked on numerous animated shows throughout her career that spans over three decades. Some of those recent roles include Zoe Trent on “Littlest Pet Shop,” Dorothy Cramp on “The Cramp Twins,” and Mrs. Clusky on “Martha Speaks.” Her extensive background also includes multiple dubs for japanese animation including the martial artist twins Ling-Ling & Lung-Lung in “Ranma ½” and the space pirate Emeraldas in “Galaxy Express 999.”

Her work in animation has earned Oliver multiple “Behind the Voice Actors Award” nominations and wins as both a stand-alone actor and as an ensemble cast. She has also played many live-action roles as well, making appearances on a variety of television series including “Supernatural,” “Psych,” and “Stargate SG-1.”
