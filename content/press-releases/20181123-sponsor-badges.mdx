# BronyCon 2019 Sponsor Badges Are Now Available For Purchase

(BALTIMORE) - BronyCon 2019 promises to be our biggest weekend ever, with four days of friends and fun in Baltimore. But for those looking to make the event even more memorable, we now have sponsor badges available for them!

Sponsor badges are a great way for those to enjoy BronyCon, get some extra perks, and help support the convention. Perks include priority seating at panels and events, early access to the Marketplace, a sponsor exclusive t-shirt, print, and more. There are multiple tiers available for purchase, each with their own perks and exclusive swag.

Those interested in purchasing a sponsor badge can do so by heading to our [Eventbrite page](https://bronycon2019.eventbrite.com).

Youâ€™ll have to act fast, as there are a limited supply of badges in each tier. As of now, we are already sold out of our Diamond Sponsor Badge tier, our highest tier that comes with lodging for the event. We still have sponsor badges available at the Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels.

And as always, make sure you are following BronyCon on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BronyCon), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bronycon), and [Telegram](https://t.me/BronyCon) to be the first to hear our latest announcements.
