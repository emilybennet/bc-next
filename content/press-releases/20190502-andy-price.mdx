# Andy Price Draws Up Plans for BronyCon This August

(BALTIMORE) - Familiar faces are essential for a successful mission. You know how they work, what their strengths are, if they believe ketchup on a hotdog is a deal breaker; all the important factors. For our final mission, BronyCon is thrilled to welcome back one of our most recognizable faces and loveable personalities, Andy Price!

This will be Price’s 6th appearance at BronyCon and first time since 2017, with his first visit happening back in 2013. He is best known as the lead pencil/ink artist for the “My Little Pony” IDW comic book series and his contributions include the “The Return of Queen Chrysalis” (issues #1-4), “Neigh Anything” (issues #11-12), and “Siege of the Crystal Empire” (issues #34-37) arcs.

Price’s work has helped the comic book series earn two Diamond Gem awards (2013 and 2014), which is voted on by comic book retailers based on sales numbers and impact on the comic book industry as a whole.

Special agent Price has also worked on numerous art projects outside of “MLP.” He’s been a penciller on properties such as “Star Trek,” “Betty and Veronica,” and done cover art for “Samurai Jack” to name a few. In addition to comics, he has made trading cards and toy designs for companies such as DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Archie Comics, LEGO, BOOM!Studios, and more.

When he isn’t drawing (or usually even when he is) you can find Andy relaxing with classic episodes of shows such as the "Dick Van Dyke Show" and "Magnum, P.I."
