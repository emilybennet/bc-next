# BronyCon Opens Artist Alley Applications For This August

(BALTIMORE) - For our final mission this year everyone has a vital role to play. We’re putting out one final call to bring in individuals who work on a different scale and we’re excited to give smaller artists a chance to vend at the convention as we announce the launch of Artist Alley applications!

Artist Alley tables are for those who create their own products or who perform commissions at the event. These spots are cheaper than traditional vendor hall booths and come in two sizes; single/half-table (4’) or double/full table (8’).

Interested individuals can find the application and marketplace guildes on our website at [https://bronycon.org/exhibit](https://bronycon.org/exhibit). We encourage all potential applicants to review our updated policies before submitting. The application will close on February, 28th, at 11:59 PM EDT. Please note, those that have already applied for BronyCon’s vendor hall will be notified of their application status prior to the closing of artist alley applications.
