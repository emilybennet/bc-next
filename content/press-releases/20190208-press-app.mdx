# BronyCon Announces The Opening of Press Applications

(BALTIMORE) - As we near closer to BronyCon’s important mission this August, agents must remember two critical aspects for any good spy: recon and information gathering. With that, BronyCon is proud to announce the opening of applications for press badges for 2019, giving approved media the chance to attend exclusive press conferences with Guests of Honor and more freedom to cover the convention!

Over the past near decade, the convention has played host to various media groups of different sizes. This year will be no different as we hope to welcome both local and far reaching press outlets looking to take in the event one last time.

Interested groups or individuals can head to [https://bronycon.org/press](https://bronycon.org/press) for more information and the application itself. A copy of BronyCon’s press policies is located at [https://www.bronycon.org/policies/press](https://www.bronycon.org/policies/press). Take note, we advise all potential applicants carefully read the press guidelines before submission. The deadline for applications is April 30th.
