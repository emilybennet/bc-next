# Tony Fleecs is Drawn to BronyCon's Final Mission

(BALTIMORE) - Clear visuals are vital in helping agents at BronyCon HQ. For our final mission this August we need someone who can create colorful characters, paint perfect pictures, and inspires others with their imagery. BronyCon’s is happy to announce our next Guest of Honor is well-suited to fit that role as Tony Fleecs will return to the convention for 2019!

This will be agent Fleecs’ sixth straight BronyCon with his first appearance happening back in 2014—our second year in Baltimore. He is best known as one of the artists on multiple series’ of the IDW “My Little Pony” comic book banner. They includes multiple issues of “Friendship is Magic,” “Friends Forever”, “Legends of Magic,” and the “My Little Pony” annual editions in 2013 and 2017. Fleecs will also lend his talent to our team one last time as he will be illustrating the convention’s book cover, something he’s done every year he has attended.

Outside of “MLP” Mr. Fleecs runs his his own self-named company; Fleecs Design. His client list includes 20th Century Fox, Disney, the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball, Discovery Channel’s “Monster Garage,” and more.
