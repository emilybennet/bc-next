# BronyCon Announces Crystal Café

(BALTIMORE) - BronyCon prides itself on having a varied amount of programming for attendees to take part in during convention weekend. In this, mission command has decided to bring back an event that made its debut last year. This August, the BronyCon Crystal Café will be holding three seperate, ticketed performances!

Those looking for a show and a way to grab a meal during the convention are sure to be interested. The café is a separately ticketed event hosted by BronyCon’s expertly trained cosplay team and will be taking place on Friday, August 2. Patrons will be served a proper meal and be entertained by performers during the two hour performance.

This year, both Princess Cadance and Pinkie Pie are putting on the celebration of a lifetime! Ticket holders will have the chance to travel to the Crystal Empire and help them charge the Crystal Heart to shine the light of friendship for many years to come. In addition, the princesses of Equestria will be hosting a Summer Sun Celebration Breakfast meet and greet earlier in the morning. Attendees will be given the chance to purchase a photo during both events to keep as souvenirs.
