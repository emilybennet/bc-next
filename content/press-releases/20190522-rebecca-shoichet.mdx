# Rebecca Shoichet Returns for Round Two at BronyCon 2019

(BALTIMORE) - In any mission, sometimes a second attempt or chance could mean the difference between success and failure. In late 2011 our event returned for a second time despite it being a complete unknown and has grown ever since. In 2012, we held an event in a second state and was able hold four thousand attendees for the first time ever. Our next special guest knows all about second chances and we’re extremely excited to welcome back Rebecca Shoichet to her second ever BronyCon this August!

This will be Rebecca’s first appearance at BronyCon since 2014. She is most recently known for her multiple roles in “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,” most prominently as the villain turned hero Sunset Shimmer, and is the singing voice for Twilight Sparkle. In addition, she has voiced other well-remembered characters such as Night Glider and Sugar Belle.

Rebecca’s voice acting career expands well beyond “MLP” as well. Some of her credits in animation include playing Wisteria in “Littlest Pet Shop,” Jane in “Tarzan and Jane,” Apple Dumpling in “Strawberry Shortcake,” and numerous characters in “Enchantimals: Finding Home.” In addition, she has also provided voices for characters in English-dubs of Japanese anime such as “Nana Osaki” and “Inuyasha.”

Outside of her studio work, Rebecca sings live with the bands Mimosa, Soulstream, and Side One. She has also toured with pop/rock artists Amanda Marshall and Tom Cochrane.
