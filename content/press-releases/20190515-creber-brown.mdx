# Michelle Creber and Gabriel Brown Groove Into BronyCon

(BALTIMORE) - There are some aspects of the BronyCon mission that are more successful if we have our agents work in pairs. Our next pair of special agents joining us this August, who need no introduction, are a perfect fit for that role. They can help our agents get in tune with each other, teach others to work in harmony, and can groove to the beat. It’s a thrill to announce Michelle Creber and Gabriel Brown as BronyCon’s next Guests of Honor!

This will be Creber’s fifth appearance at BronyCon after her debut in 2013. She is best known as the voice of Apple Bloom and the singing voice of Sweetie Belle on “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.” Creber has a wide-ranging acting career outside of “MLP” with voice roles that include Alice in “Martha Speaks,” Wendy in “The New Adventures of Peter Pan,” and Lucy in “Peanuts.” The 19-year-old has also been on numerous television shows and movies. Some of her credits include guest appearances on “The Haunting Hour” and “Supernatural,” the role of Kelly on “Strange Empire,” and “The Search for Santa Paws.”

Brown is a well-known vocalist, lending his singing talents to a wide range of projects. His voice can be heard in a variety of songs from the fifth season of “Friendship is Magic,” “Equestria Girls: Friendship Games,” and the “Songs of Harmony” album. Brown burst onto the scene with the song “Proud To Be A Brony” that was released in 2011 and earned him a name inside the fan community In addition, he is the creator of the “-licious” animated series of videos and is a member of “Bronies React.”

Together, Creber and Brown have produced three albums; “At Home,” “Getting Stronger,” and “Tribute.” Creber has also recorded two other albums, “Timeless” and “A Creber Christmas.”
