# BronyCon Announces Lineup for BronyPalooza 2019

(BALTIMORE) - Music affects everyone in a variety of ways, and the agents of BronyCon are no different. They love to groove to the beat, sing along to their favorite tunes, and dance the night away. In keeping with the tradition of bringing in the best talent the fandom has to offer, BronyCon is happy announce more than 20 acts who will be part of the final BronyPalooza in only a few weeks!

For the first time, BronyPalooza will be spread out over three nights, with the first set of acts starting on Thursday following Opening Ceremonies. This year’s lineup features a wide variety of acts and musical styles; ranging from rock bands to electronic DJs.

These acts include talents from the earliest days of the “MLP:FiM” fandom to some of today’s top producing talents. Eurobeat Brony (aka Odyssey), known for some of the earliest and well-known pieces of pony music such as “Discord” and creator of the “Super Ponybeat” album series, will be returning to the event for a second straight year while electro artists Silva Hound & ScratchAttack will be rocking the crowd as well. In addition, Guests of Honor Michelle Creber and Gabriel Brown, better known as Black Gryph0n, will be taking the stage to perform together for one last BronyCon. For the second time, Vylet Pony will be joining the BronyPalooza lineup as she uses her set to transport concert goers into various worlds and stories, along with many others as well.

The concert also gives opportunities for new groups and performances to take shape. Five acts (Luck Rock, Crusader!, Cyril the Wolf, Poni1Kenobi, and The Wonderbolts) will be combining their talents on Saturday night to form the BronyPalooza Super Band - a once in a lifetime act with additional surprise guests that can only be experienced in Baltimore this year.

Finally, but certainly not least, BronyCon is excited to announce one final performer who will be returning to BronyPalooza and the convention scene as a whole. After many years away ████████ █ ██████████ ███████████ ████ ██ ████████ ██████ █████ ███████ ██ ██████ █.
