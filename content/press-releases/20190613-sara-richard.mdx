# Sara Richard Sets the Scene for the Final BronyCon

(BALTIMORE) - Agents must know how to cover all bases for the final mission this August. Our next special agent is well-versed in that, painting pictures that help give a taste of what is in store for everyone. BronyCon is happy to announce Sara Richard as our next Guest of Honor!

This will be Richard’s third appearance at BronyCon, and second in a row. She first appeared in 2016. The New Hampshire native is best known as a cover artist for IDW’s “My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic” comic book series. She has created more than 70 different cover variants for it including one for “MLP:FiM” issue #12 to celebrate over one million issues being printed. The only copy of this cover was sold for more than \$6500 at auction.

In addition to her MLP work, Richard has produced variant covers for other comic book series. They include “Deadpool,” “Rick and Morty,” and “Bob’s Burgers.” She was also the illustrator for the 2013 Eisner-nominated children’s book, “Kitty and Dino.”

Between her time holding a pencil you can find Richard taking part in a variety of activities in her spare time such as ghost hunting, scouring the globe for the best wonton soup she can find, hang gliding, and saving turtles from busy roads just to name a few.
