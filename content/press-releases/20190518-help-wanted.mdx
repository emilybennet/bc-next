# BronyCon Maid Cafè and Departments Seeking Volunteers

(BALTIMORE) - The success of a mission is dependant on the agents that take part. For nearly a decade, volunteers have taken various roles at our events to ensure they succeed. For 2019, BronyCon still has various roles and duties that could use those final key pieces.

BronyCon’s Maid Café is returning for a second year in 2019 and is still looking for additional volunteers to make it a success! The event, which holds multiple sessions over the course of the convention, gives attendees a chance to enjoy a meal while being served by performing butlers and maids. While additional information is still being finalized, those interested in helping out can [fill out a application](/workcafe). Please note volunteers for the café are only eligible for a compensated 4-Day badge and no other staff amenities.

Furthermore, multiple departments are seeking additional volunteers to aid in our final mission this August. These applications can be found at [https://bronycon.org/about#volunteer](/about#volunteer).

BronyCon’s security team is looking for members to aid in roles such as Line Control, Rules Enforcement, and Special Events. Line Control gives aid during the set-up to events by making sure attendees are organized in a safe and non-intrusive manner around the convention center while Rules Enforcement helps make sure convention guidelines are being followed.

Special Events on the other hand are some of the biggest roles by helping with events such as BronyPalooza, the Grand Galloping Gala, and in areas such as Mane Event Hall or the Hall of Chaos.

Another team seeking additional help is the VIP Relations team. The people in black who help BronyCon’s Guest of Honor during their visit to Baltimore in multiple aspects. The team is particularly interested in drivers who can take our Guests of Honor around Baltimore. This position has some specific requirements; applicants must be 21 or older and have a valid driver's license.
