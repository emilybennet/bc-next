"Hi, I’m Trish, and in typical artist fashion I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil. I am extremely passionate about the vast array of emotions that can be created with drawing. I love expressions! My influences come from Disney, 1980s cartoons, and Don Bluth in particular. I could write for days about how art makes me feel, but instead just know that I really love cartoons and the process behind classic animation. My career in art provides me with a variety of opportunities. My work has been featured on several covers of IDW’s _My Little Pony_ comic series and on an ENTERPLAY pony trading card. I’ve also done a massive amount of work for BronyCon, where I have been art director for the last six years. I design plush toys, enamel pins, and produce art used for sculptures and mascot costumes. My original characters are featured in animated videos such as Children of the Night, and in games such as Jungle Kartz. New opportunities are around every corner and I can’t wait to see what I draw next!"
