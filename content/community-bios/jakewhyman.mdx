He's a long time pony video editor who just doesn't know when to quit. He's done multiple things like ponifying _Game Grumps_ videos, making bootleg _Equestria Girls_ episodes, editing various comedy PMVs, created _Brownies React_, making shorts for _Ponies: The Anthology_ 3-7, and now is one of the coordinators for the 7th installment of _Ponies: The Anthology_.

He also makes jokes on Twitter, I guess...
