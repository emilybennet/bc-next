Who is this goofball? And why can’t people stop staring at that mustache?

Dusty's life is a manly checklist. The son of an auto worker (have you driven a Ford lately?), high school and college athlete (baseball, football), former bodyguard and ranch hand, trained Big Time wrestler, and Harley mechanic whose custom motorcycles have appeared on the cover of _Easyriders_. A pessimist would say “he can’t make up his mind”; an optimist would say “no single career is big enough for his mustache”.

And he watches a cartoon show intended for little girls. Well, what do you expect from the _Manliest Brony in the World_?

What’s with that? Well, aside from making him grin like someone who just found a twenty dollar bill in his underwear, it’s given him a chance to do what he does best: ham it up. Dusty is known primarily for his former show _Stay Brony My Friends_, his YouTube videos which have gone viral, and separating convention-goers from their money at charity auctions. Dusty fearlessly treads upon the crushed skulls of YouTube trolls and hack journalists as he destroys stereotypes. What he is most proud of, though, is his fans. The finest bronies in the world (his audience… that includes YOU, right?) have come together to raise over 50,000 dollars for a variety of charities. This has also piqued the curiosity of documentary filmmakers.

He can be seen in _Thatch and Dial_, a YouTube series he is collaborating on with Andy Stein (Mandopony), as well at the _Analyst Anarchy TF2_ series with Dr. Wolf and friends. His continued appearances on _Bronies React_, and he has lent his voice to “Backstrap” in the _Fallout Equestria_ radio play by East Corp. Productions as well as in the animation _Allister and Melody_ by Luximus as Randy (hot dog guy)

He co-stared in a student film called _Under_ with an on screen roll and he is also the Audiobook narrator for the Fantasy/Sci-Fi _Portals of Infinity_ series, book 3 _Of Temples and Trials_, book 4 _The Sea of Grass_ and Book 5 _Demigods and Deities_ are all available on both Audible and Ibooks with more to come!

Stay Brony, my Friends.
