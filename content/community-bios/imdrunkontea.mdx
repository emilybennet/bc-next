A native of the West Coast, imdrunkonTea is best known for his semi-kinda-quasi-realistic painting style, love of all things geeky, and and obsession with terrible, terrible puns. When he’s not painting ponies or magical human pony hybrids with huge hair, he can be found singing karaoke in his car, watching animated movies, and failing miserably against 13 year olds in online games. He's had the pleasure of serving as a design lead for Everfree Northwest for the last two years, as well as contributing to a number of other pony-related fan projects and spinoffs.

Oh, and before you ask – the answer is jasmine (tea).
