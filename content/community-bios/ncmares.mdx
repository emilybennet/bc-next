"I am NC and I like to draw pretty pictures! I've been in the fandom for 6(!) phenomenal years and have loved every minute of it. I've drawn plenty in that time, from ponies packing weapons-grade cuteness to ponies plain packing weapons. It's been a blast drawing pony and being apart of the fandom!"
