Foal Papers, known (occasionally affectionately) as Foaly or “that Brit”, has been a fan of candy-colored magical friendship horses since early 2011, when he was supposed to be studying for final exams and so was naturally open to any and all available online distractions. The pilot episode left him intrigued; by “Winter Wrap Up” he was hooked.

Since then, he’s presented on the links between _MLP:FiM_ and Greek mythology at both academic conferences and fan conventions around the world. At the latter, he’s also moderated discussion and Q&A panels with many of the Powers That Be of the franchise, co-hosted a plethora of charity auctions with Dustykatt that have collectively raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from generous pony fans for excellent causes, and generally run around as a community guest in a perpetual unspecified hurry whilst looking politely befuddled. Online, he’s participated in a variety of livestreams and shows, been active in shaping the fan community on Twitter, and tracked the fandom’s charity and convention undertakings using a variety of spreadsheets. Mmm. Spreadsheets. Oh, and somewhere in there he also managed to pass those pesky finals.

Foaly enjoys tea and Jaffa cakes more than can possibly be healthy, and is uncomfortable yet vaguely amused describing himself in the third person. When he’s not getting ejected from libraries for smelling the books or tweeting too much on [@foalpapers](https://twitter.com/foalpapers), you can find him raising prizewinning alpacas for the indie lamini racing circuit, and writing shameless fibs in his autobiographical blurbs. Be excellent to each other.
