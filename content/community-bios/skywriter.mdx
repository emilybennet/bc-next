Jeffrey C. "Skywriter" Wells is an award-winning comic scripter and author of short fictions, who started writing _My Little Pony_ fanfic on a lark in late 2011 and has never fully been the same since. A professional pony princess fanboy, Jeffrey is best known for his elaborate canon-prequel series _Cadance of Cloudsdale_, as well as the bizarrely-popular short stories _Derplicty_ and _Princess Celestia Hates Tea_. He also loves tiaras.
