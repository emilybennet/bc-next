"All this guy does is snark-post on twitter at everyone. Be it your regular brony, show VA, DHX staffer, you name it and he somehow or another gets away with it. He doesn't animate, he doesn't voice act, he sure as heck isn't an artist and Celestia forbid he tries to start a Youtube channel. He's just that grumpy guard pone that everyone seems to love and adore for one reason or another, something he's physically unable to comprehend." â€”Scope
