Bonnie Zacherle joined Hasbro in 1980. While working as an Illustrator in Hasbroâ€™s Research and Design department, Ms. Zacherle called upon her fond childhood memories of Horses and horse riding to create _My Little Pony_ and _My Pretty Pony_ (the precursor to the _My Little Pony_ line). In addition to _My Little Pony_, Ms. Zacherle worked on the redesigned Mr. Potato Head while at Hasbro. Shortly before _My Little Pony_ hit the market, Ms. Zacherle left Hasbro to work for Parker Brothers where she created the Nerfuls toy line. Later, she opened a studio focusing on freelance work, design and consultation services with her friend and former Hasbro colleague, Liz Knight in a renovated barn in Massachusetts.

Ms. Zacherle currently lives in Warrenton, Virginia and teaches art to children.
