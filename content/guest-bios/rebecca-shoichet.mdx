Every time you watch an episode of _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic_, you hear the voice of Rebecca Shoichet singing the show's opening theme song. She is the singing voice for the pony princess, Twilight Sparkle! You may also know her as the reformed villain, Sunset Shimmer, in all the _Equestria Girls_ movies. She has also voiced two other pony characters in the _FiM_ series, Night Glider, and Big Mac's sweetheart, Sugar Belle. Some other fave voice credits of Rebecca's are Jane in _Tarzan and Jane_, Sage, Caper, Flap, and others in _Enchantimals: Finding Home_, Wisteria in _Littlest Pet Shop_, XR4TI in _Supernoobs_, Apple Dumpling in _Strawberry Shortcake_, Willi in _Maya the Bee_ (the North American version season 1), Lorne in _Kid vs. Kat_, Agent Abigail Brand in _Astonishing X-Men_, Nana Osaka in the English dubbing of _Nana_ and a few other super-sweet, up-coming roles that she's not allowed to talk about yet! Besides in-studio work, Rebecca also sings live with bands Soulstream, Side One, and Mimosa. And has toured with pop/rock artists Tom Cochrane and Amanda Marshall. Rebecca is stoked to be a part of the MLP family and can't wait to come and meet all of you! See you at BronyCon!
