In addition to building an impressive music career as one-half of the award-winning recording duo One More Girl (with her sister Carly), Britt McKillip has been acting in film and television since she could talk—literally.

Hailing from Vancouver, BC and riding the wave of a surging west coast film industry, Britt’s extensive resume reflects her deep level of talent and commitment to entertainment culture. In addition to appearing in a number of films and playing offbeat character Reggie in the critically acclaimed series _Dead Like Me_, Britt has voiced dozens of animation series including _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ as Sabrina, Disney’s _Baby Loony Toons_ as Baby Lola, _Bratz_ as Chloe, _Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu_ as Harumi, the wildly popular _My Little Pony_ as Princess Cadance, and most recently in the Netflix series _Super Monsters_ as Esmie and _Lego Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit_ as Claire Dearing.

Between juggling a flourishing career as a recording artist, and passionate immersion in an industry that recognizes her as a highly successful voice, film and television actor, entertainment multi-tasking continues to be a way life for this talented young performer.
