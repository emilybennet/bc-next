# Cosplay Fashion Show Rules

Come strut your stuff at the BronyCon 2019 Cosplay Fashion Show. Participants will have the opportunity to show off “the art of the dress” in this cosplay event. Awards will only be given to participants who have registered for the craftsmanship-focused Hall Cosplay Contest. However, if you are someone who would just like to show off your costume in front of an audience, this is the event for you. You are still required to register in order to walk on stage; this will be on a first-come, first-served basis

> If you would like to compete in the competitive Hall Cosplay Contest, please see the [Hall Cosplay Contest Rules](/policies/hall-cosplay-contest).

[Pre-Registration for the Fashion Show is now available](https://forms.gle/o951GjAVVbC2dSCw9). At-con Cosplay Fashion Show registration times will be announced soon.

Any participant who does not follow the rules of the Fashion Show, misses line-up times, or does not follow the instructions of Events Staff during the event, may be disqualified at the discretion of the Cosplay Manager.
