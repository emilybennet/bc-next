# bronycon-next

New marketing site for BronyCon running off Next and Express.

## Run the Project

1. Clone repo locally.
2. Install dependencies `npm install`.
3. Run the project `npm run dev`.
4. Best of luck, things are a bit… disorganized.

## Deployment

For ease, this project is deployed to [Now](https://now.sh) instead of Luna.

1. Install the Now CLI `npm install -g now`.
2. Switch to the BronyCon org (Design can add you, just make sure you have a Zeit account first).
3. Run `now` and follow the prompts.
4. If the staging URL looks good, `now alias` to push live.
